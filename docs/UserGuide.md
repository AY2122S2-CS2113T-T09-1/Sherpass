# Sherpass User Guide

## Introduction

Sherpass is a desktop application for students to manage their academic schedules and also provide a platform for them
to focus on their academic tasks.
Optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),
users who can type fast will be able to plan out their tasks in a much quicker fashion compared to traditional GUI apps.

### Managing your time
You can add your tasks into Sherpass and get a detailed outline of your schedule. Using this schedule, you won't
have to worry ever again about forgetting tasks and missing deadlines!

Sherpass also allows you to easily add recurring tasks (e.g. classes). Simply refer to the command details for
more information.

### Study sessions
Having trouble focusing while studying? Sherpass's study sessions allow you to select study timers, inspired by the
increasingly popular [Pomodoro study sessions](https://examstudyexpert.com/pomodoro-study-method/), to help you keep track of the time whilst completing your tasks.

#### During Study sessions
Starting the study session will show you the tasks that you have planned to do for the day. You can then choose to
start one of a few default timers provided by us, or start your own custom timer. You can also choose to start a
stopwatch to keep track of how long you've been studying for, if you're unsure of how long you will need.

#### After Study sessions
After your study session, you will be prompted to mark the tasks you've completed as done. If you're still not done with
certain tasks, feel free to start another productive session!

### User Guide Target Audience
New and inexperienced users who want to use Sherpass, as well as non-users who want to know more about what Sherpass
can do.
